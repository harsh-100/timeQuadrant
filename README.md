##  💡 Got Idea from

- 7 Habbits of highly effective people by <b>Stephen Covey</b> 
- Meaning of Task in Every quadrant
1. Urgent & Important         👉 Do it Now ,
2. Urgent But Not Important   👉 Try to assign the task to someone ,
3. Not Urgent but Important   👉 Schedule It (Mostly the long term task like reading , exercise , learning new skill etc )
4. Not Urgent Not Important   👉 Avoid these task and Don't waste your time in such tasks
